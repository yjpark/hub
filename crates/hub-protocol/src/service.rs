//! The vox service traits — the RPC surface each role dials.
//!
//! Three services, split by *who dials whom* so a peer only ever sees the
//! methods its role should call:
//!
//! - [`NodeIngress`] is dialed *into* the hub by a **node** that reverse-dials to
//!   offer itself (§2.1, §2.4). Its one job is to register.
//! - [`ConsumerApi`] is dialed *into* the hub by a **consumer** (the console or
//!   the agent shim) to discover the mesh and route calls (§1, §2.6).
//! - [`NodeService`] is what the hub dials back *toward a node*. The node answers
//!   here — it never binds a local listener (§2.4).
//!
//! The `#[vox::service]` macro generates a `…Client` and a `…Dispatcher` for each
//! trait; this crate ships the *contract only*, so no implementations live here.
